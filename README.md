| ![logoonly](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/835713ba-7a74-4dc9-9447-fc048ef8189c) | ![logowithtext](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c23544cc-24c3-49ce-9580-b606a96fcdb8) |

## 🧠 Concept

The logo combines core themes of:
- **Security & Authentication** (padlock + shield),
- **Solana Ecosystem** (Solana "S" symbol),
- **Clean and Professional UI Branding**, tailored for modern apps.

All typography uses the **Baloo Bhai 2** font as required, with minimal balancing tweaks.

## 🎨 Design Principles

- ✅ Modern and professional style
- ✅ Primary color scheme: Solana Purple `#9945FF` and Solana Green `#14F195` in gradient
- ✅ Visual elements: Lock + Shield + Solana “S” mark
- ✅ Variants for both dark and light backgrounds
- ✅ Includes: Icon-only and Icon+Text versions
- ✅ Scales cleanly to small and large resolutions (512–4096px)
- ✅ Organized Figma layers with logical naming (`lock`, `shield`, `S Vector`, etc.)
